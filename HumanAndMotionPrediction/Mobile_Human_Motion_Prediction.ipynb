    "The purpose of this project is to explore the dataset generated by multiple motion/vital sensors on 10 human volunteers. The dataset was provided for reaseach purposese by Oresti Baños, et al., at the University of Granada. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a model can be constructed that can predict subjects' instantaneous motion with high accuracy, it can be really beneficial in some cases when subjects want to be monitored for their own goods (i.e. health-related issues). However, in cases when subjects do not want to be monitored, such a model may be undesirable. Unfortunately, mobile phones with various types of high-quality sensors are ubiquitous in these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus on the latter case mentioned above. Followed by the detailed EDA, a few models will be trained with different subsets of data to investigate how accurately the model can predict the motion with sensor data. In parallel, similar models will be trained and investigated for slightly different purpose; to see if the model would be able to identify specific subject based on the sensor data.\n",

    "Even though the training dataset could be highly biased (coming from only 10 different subjects), this project showed that ***the monitoring devices with minimal amount of sensors and data (~0.5 seconds) can predict different motions and even identify the specific subject with almost perfect accuracy (~ >95%)***. The sensor that contributed most to such high prediction accuracy was the **gyro** sensors that measure the rate of turn in deg/s.\n",

    "This may suggest that most mobile phones and smart watches can have an easy access to these types of user-specific private information. When used for good purposes, it can be beneficial. However, in the opposite case, it may cause a serious breach in user privacy."
